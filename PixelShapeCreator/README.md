An unfinished program for drawing shapes and displaying their data in the terminal

things learned:
- better understanding of abstract classes and inheritance
- interfaces
- abstraction (I think? don't know the actual name tbh)
- Bresenham's algorithm (does not work)

Gonna fix later when I'm better

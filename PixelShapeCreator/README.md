An unfinished program for drawing shapes and displaying their data in the terminal

things learned:
- better understanding of abstract classes and inheritance
- interfaces
- abstraction (I think? don't know the actual name tbh)
- Bresenham's algorithm (does not work)

For now triangle and circle isn't working (I have an idea for circle tho).
Gonna fix later when I'm better
